## Project Structure

### Addons
The `addons` folder contains any third-party plugins or extensions that enhance the functionality of the Godot Engine. These can include tools, scripts, or other resources that are not part of the core engine but add additional features.

### Assets
The `assets` folder is where all the game's assets are stored. This includes images, sounds, music, and other media files that are used in the game. It is organized into subfolders like `music`, `sfx`, and `sprites` to keep different types of assets separate.

### Autoloads
The `autoloads` folder contains scripts or scenes that are set to autoload in the Godot project settings. These are globally accessible and can be used to manage game states, singletons, or other global data and functionality.

### Docs
The `docs` folder contains documentation related to the project. This can include design documents, technical specifications, user guides, and other written materials that help explain the game's development process and usage.

### Resources
The `resources` folder is used to store reusable resources such as materials, shaders, and other assets that can be shared across multiple scenes or objects in the game.

### Scenes
The `scenes` folder contains all the scene files for the game. Each scene represents a different part of the game, such as a level, menu, or UI screen. Scenes are composed of nodes and can be nested to create complex hierarchies.

### Scripts
The `scripts` folder is where all the GDScript files are stored. These scripts define the behavior of the game's objects and are attached to nodes within the scenes. Scripts can control gameplay mechanics, handle user input, and manage game logic.

### Shaders
The `shaders` folder contains shader files used in the game. Shaders are programs that run on the GPU to control the rendering of graphics, allowing for advanced visual effects such as lighting, shadows, and post-processing.
