- A game where you have the power to spawn flowers (maybe a puzzle platformer [Flower Power]). Could have multiple kinds of plant, like a bouncy flower, elevating flower, slow fall flower. You could also sprout the flowers instead of planting them so it would be like a power up. 
- A horror coded game where you have to keep the lights on by running in a gerbil wheel or maybe collecting batteries. There are npcs that are friendly/helpful until the lights go out where they become shadows of themselves and hunt/harass you. Your goal is to get out of the house or something like that
- A game where you have the ability to press a button that will shock the person in front of you. The more you press it the more painful it becomes. Maybe it's a narrative game where the person is being obnoxious or something but as the game progresses it gets more ambiguous as to whether you should be pressing it. (Like that experiment where the person getting shocked was an actor)
- An fps where you are a robot and have to periodically jump inside of yourself and motivate the gerbil that is powering you. Might involve collecting carrots in the overworld or doing a dancing minigame

You spawn with a gerbil and a charging station and must mine coal adjacent materials and iron or something in order to build an electrical system that might connect to more charging stations/teleporter/mining lasers/mine carts/lights/teslacoils/laser turrets. There might also be personal battery upgrades/drill upgrades/personal light upgrades. There could be simple swarming enemies that chase any player made structures near them. There might be variations of enemies ie. explosive enemies.
